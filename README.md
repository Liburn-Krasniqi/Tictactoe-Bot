## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
To run this game on your machine, you'll need to install the required libraries and set up a Python virtual environment.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- [Pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/) for rendering the game interface.

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Liburn-Krasniqi/Tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe-ai
2. Create a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Game:
    ```bash
    python GUI.py

## üß† How the AI Works
The AI bot uses the **Minimax algorithm**, which evaluates all possible moves to choose the one that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing yours. This makes the bot impossible to beat but an excellent way to hone your skills.

## üöÄ Planned Updates
- Add difficulty levels for players of all skill ranges.
- Implement a real-time **multiplayer mode**.
